		This schema encodes the Reference System (RS_) package of the extended UML Model for OGC Abstract Specification Topic 2: Spatial Referencing by Coordinates. That UML model is adapted from ISO 19111 - Spatial referencing by coordinates, as described in Annex C of Topic 2. The SC_CRS class is also encoded here, to eliminate the (circular) references from coordinateOperations.xsd to coordinateReferenceSystems.xsd. The RS_SpatialReferenceSystemUsingGeographicIdentifier class is not encoded, since it is not applicable to coordinate positions. The CI_Citation class is not directly encoded, since such information can be included as metaDataProperty elements which are optionally allowed. A modified version of the EX_Extent (DataType) class from ISO 19115 is currently encoded here, using GML 3 schema types. (A more extensive version of the EX_Extent package might be XML encoded in the future, probably in a separate extent.xsd schema.)

      <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The temporal topology schema for ISO19136 provides constructs for handling topological complexes and 
		temporal feature relationships. 
		Temporal geometric characteristics of features are represented as instants and periods. 
		While, temporal context of features that does not relate to the position of time is described as connectivity relationships 
		among instants and periods. These relationships are called temporal topology as they do not change in time, 
		as long as the direction of time does not change. 
		It is used effectively in the case of describing a family tree expressing evolution of species, an ecological cycle, 
		a lineage of lands or buildings, or a history of separation and merger of administrative boundaries.
		This schema reflects a partial yet consistent implementation of the model described in ISO 19108:2002.

      <rdfs:comment>This is an abstract class</rdfs:comment>
      <rdfs:comment>A discrete coverage consists of a domain set, range set and optionally a coverage function. The domain set consists of either geometry or temporal objects, finite in number. The range set is comprised of a finite number of attribute values each of which is associated to every direct position within any single spatiotemporal object in the domain. In other words, the range values are constant on each spatiotemporal object in the domain. This coverage function maps each element from the coverage domain to an element in its range. This definition conforms to ISO 19123.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Ordinal temporal reference systems are often hierarchically structured 
      such that an ordinal era at a given level of the hierarchy includes a 
      sequence of shorter, coterminous ordinal eras. This captured using the member/group properties.  
      
      Note that in this schema, TIme Ordinal Era is patterned on TimeEdge, which is a variation from ISO 19108.  
      This is in order to fulfill the requirements of ordinal reference systems based on eras delimited by 
      named points or nodes, which are common in geology, archeology, etc.

The negatively and positively directed nodes correspond to the start and end nodes respectively. The optional coboundary of an edge is a circular sequence of directed faces which are incident on this edge in document order. Faces which use a particular boundary edge in its positive orientation appear with positive orientation on the coboundary of the same edge. In the 2D case, the orientation of the face on the left of the edge is "+"; the orientation of the face on the right on its right is "-".

      <rdfs:comment>. The topological boundary of a face consists of a set of directed edges. Note that all edges associated with a Face, including dangling and interior edges, appear in the boundary.  Dangling and interior edges are each referenced by pairs of directedEdges with opposing orientations.  The optional coboundary of a face is a pair of directed solids which are bounded by this face. If present, there is precisely one positively directed and one negatively directed solid in the coboundary of every face. The positively directed solid corresponds to the solid which lies in the direction of the positively directed normal to the face in any geometric realisation.  A face may optionally be realised by a 2-dimensional (surface) geometric primitive.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A mathematical operation on coordinates that transforms or converts coordinates to another coordinate reference system. Many but not all coordinate operations (from CRS A to CRS B) also uniquely define the inverse operation (from CRS B to CRS A). In some cases, the operation method algorithm for the inverse operation is the same as for the forward algorithm, but the signs of some operation parameter values must be reversed. In other cases, different algorithms are required for the forward and inverse operations, but the same operation parameter values are used. If (some) entirely different parameter values are needed, a different coordinate operation shall be defined.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>An ordered sequence of two or more single coordinate operations. The sequence of operations is constrained by the requirement that the source coordinate reference system of step (n+1) must be the same as the target coordinate reference system of step (n). The source coordinate reference system of the first step and the target coordinate reference system of the last step are the source and target coordinate reference system associated with the concatenated operation. Instead of a forward operation, an inverse operation may be used for one or more of the operation steps mentioned above, if the inverse operation is uniquely defined by the forward operation.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>This is an abstract class</rdfs:comment>
      <rdfs:comment>An abstract operation on coordinates that does not include any change of datum. The best-known example of a coordinate conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing coordinate conversions are defined rather than empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no parameters.

This abstract complexType is expected to be extended for well-known operation methods with many Conversion instances, in Application Schemas that define operation-method-specialized element names and contents. This conversion uses an operation method, usually with associated parameter values. However, operation methods and parameter values are directly associated with concrete subtypes, not with this abstract type. All concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include a "usesMethod" element that references the "OperationMethod" element. Similarly, all concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include zero or more elements each named "uses...Value" that each use the type of an element substitutable for the "_generalParameterValue" element. </rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>This is an abstract class</rdfs:comment>
      <rdfs:comment>An abstract operation on coordinates that usually includes a change of Datum. The parameters of a coordinate transformation are empirically derived from data containing the coordinates of a series of points in both coordinate reference systems. This computational process is usually "over-determined", allowing derivation of error (or accuracy) estimates for the transformation. Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result in multiple (different) versions of the same coordinate transformation.

This abstract complexType is expected to be extended for well-known operation methods with many Transformation instances, in Application Schemas that define operation-method-specialized value element names and contents. This transformation uses an operation method with associated parameter values. However, operation methods and parameter values are directly associated with concrete subtypes, not with this abstract type. All concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include a "usesMethod" element that references one "OperationMethod" element. Similarly, all concrete types derived from this type shall extend this type to include one or more elements each named "uses...Value" that each use the type of an element substitutable for the "_generalParameterValue" element. </rdfs:comment>

NOTE: The allowed geometry elements contained in such a property (or referenced by it) have to be modelled by an XML Schema choice element since the composites inherit both from geometric complex *and* geometric primitive and are already part of the _GeometricPrimitive substitution group.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A non-abstract generic collection type that can be used as a document element for a collection of any GML types - Geometries, Topologies, Features ...

FeatureCollections may only contain Features.  GeometryCollections may only contain Geometrys.  Bags are less constrained  they must contain objects that are substitutable for gml:_Object.  This may mix several levels, including Features, Definitions, Dictionaries, Geometries etc.  

The content model would ideally be 
   member 0..*
   members 0..1
   member 0..*
for maximum flexibility in building a collection from both homogeneous and distinct components: 
included "member" elements each contain a single Object
an included "members" element contains a set of Objects 

However, this is non-deterministic, thus prohibited by XSD.</rdfs:comment>

   <owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.opengis.net/gml#AssociationType">
      <rdfs:comment>A pattern or base for derived types used to specify complex types corresponding to an  unspecified UML association - either composition or aggregation.  Restricts the cardinality of Objects contained in the association to a maximum of one.  An instance of this type can contain an element representing an Object, or serve as a pointer to a remote Object.  

Descendents of this type can be restricted in an application schema to 
* allow only specified classes as valid participants in the aggregation
* allow only association by reference (i.e. empty the content model) or by value (i.e. remove the xlinks).    

When used for association by reference, the value of the gml:remoteSchema attribute can be used to locate a schema fragment that constrains the target instance.   

In many cases it is desirable to impose the constraint prohibiting the occurence of both reference and value in the same instance, as that would be ambiguous.  This is accomplished by adding a directive in the annotation element of the element declaration.  This directive can be in the form of normative prose, or can use a Schematron pattern to automatically constrain co-occurrence - see the declaration for _strictAssociation below.   

If co-occurence is not prohibited, then both a link and content may be present.  If this occurs in an instance, then the rule for interpretation is that the instance found by traversing the href provides the normative value of the property, and should be used when possible.  The value(s) included as content may be used if the remote instance cannot be resolved.  This may be considered to be a "cached" version of the value(s).</rdfs:comment>

Ideally this type would be derived by extension of AssociationType.  
However, this leads to a non-deterministic content model, since both the base and the extension have minOccurs="0", and is thus prohibited in XML Schema.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A coordinate system (CS) is the set of coordinate system axes that spans a given coordinate space. A CS is derived from a set of (mathematical) rules for specifying how coordinates in a given space are to be assigned to points. The coordinate values in a coordinate tuple shall be recorded in the order in which the coordinate system axes associations are recorded, whenever those coordinates use a coordinate reference system that uses this coordinate system.

A property that has a polygon as its value domain can either be an appropriate geometry element encapsulated in an element of this type or an XLink reference to a remote geometry element (where remote includes geometry elements located elsewhere in the same document).

      <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This type extends the built-in xsd:decimal simple type to allow floating-point 
      values for temporal length. According to  the ISO 11404 model you have to use 
      positiveInteger together with appropriate values for radix and factor. The 
      resolution of the time interval is to one radix ^(-factor) of the specified 
      time unit (e.g. unit="second", radix="10", factor="3" specifies a resolution 
      of milliseconds). It is a subtype of TimeDurationType.</rdfs:comment>

      Indeterminate time values are also allowed, as described in ISO 19108. The indeterminatePosition 
      attribute can be used alone or it can qualify a specific value for temporal position (e.g. before

      <rdfs:comment>Curve is a 1-dimensional primitive. Curves are continuous, connected, and have a measurable length in terms of the coordinate system. 
				A curve is composed of one or more curve segments. Each curve segment within a curve may be defined using a different interpolation method. The curve segments are connected to one another, with the end point of each segment except the last being the start point of the next segment in the segment list.
				The orientation of the curve is positive.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A placement takes a standard geometric
   construction and places it in geographic space. It defines a
   transformation from a constructive parameter space to the 
   co-ordinate space of the co-ordinate reference system being used.  
   Parameter spaces in formulae in this International Standard are 
   given as (u, v) in 2D and(u, v, w) in 3D. Co-ordinate reference 
   systems positions are given in formulae, in this International 
   Standard, by either (x, y) in 2D, or (x, y, z) in 3D.

   Affine placements are defined by linear transformations from 
   parameter space to the target co-ordiante space. 2-dimensional 
   Cartesian parameter space,(u,v) transforms into 3-dimensional co-
   ordinate reference systems,(x,y,z) by using an affine 
   transformation,(u,v)-&gt;(x,y,z) which is defined :

	x	ux vx  	x0
			 u	  
	y =	uy vy   + y0
			 v		
	x	uz vz	z0
	
   Then, given this equation, the location element of the 
   AffinePlacement is the direct position (x0, y0, z0), which is the
   target position of the origin in (u, v). The two reference
   directions (ux, uy, uz) and (vx, vy, vz) are the target     
   directions of the unit vectors at the origin in (u, v).</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A clothoid, or Cornu's spiral, is plane
   curve whose curvature is a fixed function of its length.
   In suitably chosen co-ordinates it is given by Fresnel's
   integrals.

    x(t) = 0-integral-t cos(AT*T/2)dT    
    
    y(t) = 0-integral-t sin(AT*T/2)dT
   
   This geometry is mainly used as a transition curve between
   curves of type straight line to circular arc or circular arc
   to circular arc. With this curve type it is possible to 
   achieve a C2-continous transition between the above mentioned
   curve types. One formula for the Clothoid is A*A = R*t where
   A is constant, R is the varying radius of curvature along the
   the curve and t is the length along and given in the Fresnel 
   integrals.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>Cubic splines are similar to line strings in that they are a sequence of segments each with its own defining function. A cubic spline uses the control points and a set of derivative parameters to define a piecewise 3rd degree polynomial interpolation. Unlike line-strings, the parameterization by arc length is not necessarily still a polynomial. 
				The function describing the curve must be C2, that is, have a continuous 1st and 2nd derivative at all points, and pass through the controlPoints in the order given. Between the control points, the curve segment is defined by a cubic polynomial. At each control point, the polynomial changes in such a manner that the 1st and 2nd derivative vectors are the same from either side. The control parameters record must contain vectorAtStart, and vectorAtEnd which are the unit tangent vectors at controlPoint[1] and controlPoint[n] where n = controlPoint.count. 
				Note: only the direction of the vectors is relevant, not their length.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A Surface is a 2-dimensional primitive and is composed of one or more surface patches. The surface patches are connected to one another.
				The orientation of the surface is positive ("up"). The orientation of a surface chooses an "up" direction through the choice of the upward normal, which, if the surface is not a cycle, is the side of the surface from which the exterior boundary appears counterclockwise. Reversal of the surface orientation reverses the curve orientation of each boundary component, and interchanges the conceptual "up" and "down" direction of the surface. If the surface is the boundary of a solid, the "up" direction is usually outward. For closed surfaces, which have no boundary, the up direction is that of the surface patches, which must be consistent with one another. Its included surface patches describe the interior structure of the Surface.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A Ring is used to represent a single connected component of a surface boundary. It consists of a sequence of curves connected in a cycle (an object whose boundary is empty).
A Ring is structurally similar to a composite curve in that the endPoint of each curve in the sequence is the startPoint of the next curve in the Sequence. Since the sequence is circular, there is no exception to this rule. Each ring, like all boundaries, is a cycle and each ring is simple.
NOTE: Even though each Ring is simple, the boundary need not be simple. The easiest case of this is where one of the interior rings of a surface is tangent to its exterior ring.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A gridded surface is a parametric curve
   surface derived from a rectangular grid in the parameter
   space. The rows from this grid are control points for
   horizontal surface curves; the columns are control points
   for vertical surface curves. The working assumption is that
   for a pair of parametric co-ordinates (s, t) that the
   horizontal curves for each integer offset are calculated
   and evaluated at "s". The defines a sequence of control
   points:
   
   cn(s) : s  1 .....columns 

   From this sequence a vertical curve is calculated for "s",
   and evaluated at "t". In most cases, the order of
   calculation (horizontal-vertical vs. vertical-horizontal)
   does not make a difference. Where it does, the horizontal-   
   vertical order shall be the one used.

   Logically, any pair of curve interpolation types can lead
   to a subtype of GriddedSurface. The following clauses
   define some most commonly encountered surfaces that can
   be represented in this manner.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A sphere is a gridded surface given as a
   family of circles whose positions vary linearly along the
   axis of the sphere, and whise radius varies in proportions to
   the cosine function of the central angle. The horizontal 
   circles resemble lines of constant latitude, and the vertical
   arcs resemble lines of constant longitude. 
   NOTE! If the control points are sorted in terms of increasing
   longitude, and increasing latitude, the upNormal of a sphere
   is the outward normal.
   EXAMPLE If we take a gridded set of latitudes and longitudes
   in degrees,(u,v) such as

	(-90,-180)  (-90,-90)  (-90,0)  (-90,  90) (-90, 180) 
	(-45,-180)  (-45,-90)  (-45,0)  (-45,  90) (-45, 180) 
	(  0,-180)  (  0,-90)  (  0,0)  (  0,  90) (  0, 180)
	( 45,-180)  ( 45,-90)  ( 45,0)  ( 45, -90) ( 45, 180)
	( 90,-180)  ( 90,-90)  ( 90,0)  ( 90, -90) ( 90, 180)
   
   And map these points to 3D using the usual equations (where R
   is the radius of the required sphere).

    z = R sin u
    x = (R cos u)(sin v)
    y = (R cos u)(cos v)

   We have a sphere of Radius R, centred at (0,0), as a gridded
   surface. Notice that the entire first row and the entire last
   row of the control points map to a single point in each 3D
   Euclidean space, North and South poles respectively, and that
   each horizontal curve closes back on itself forming a 
   geometric cycle. This gives us a metrically bounded (of finite
   size), topologically unbounded (not having a boundary, a
   cycle) surface.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A solid is the basis for 3-dimensional geometry. The extent of a solid is defined by the boundary surfaces (shells). A shell is represented by a composite surface, where every  shell is used to represent a single connected component of the boundary of a solid. It consists of a composite surface (a list of orientable surfaces) connected in a topological cycle (an object whose boundary is empty). Unlike a Ring, a Shell's elements have no natural sort order. Like Rings, Shells are simple.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>Specialization for georeferenced textures, i.e. textures using a planimetric projection. Such textures
				contain an implicit parameterization (either stored within the image file, in an acompanying world file, or using the
				"referencePoint" and "orientation"-elements). A georeference provided by "referencePoint" and "orientation" always takes
				precedence. The search order for an external georeference is determined by the boolean flag preferWorldFile. If this flag
				is set to true (its default value), a world file is looked for first and only if it is not found the georeference from the
				image data is used. If preferWorldFile is false, the world file is used only if no georeference from the image data is
				available. The "boundedBy"-property should contain the bounding box of the projected image data. Since a georeferenced
				texture has a unique parameterization, "target" only provides links to surface geometry without any additional texture
				parameterization. Only gml:MultiSurface or decendants of gml:AbstractSurfaceType are valid targets.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>Texture parameterization using a transformation matrix. The transformation matrix "worldToTexture" can be
				used to derive texture coordinates from an object's location. This 3x4 matrix T computes the coordinates (s,t) from a
				homogeneous world position p as (s,t) = (s'/q', t'/q') with (s', t', q') = T*p. Thus, perspective projections can be
				specified. The SRS can be specified using standard attributes. If an object is given in a different reference system, it
				is transformed to the SRS before applying the transformation. A transformation matrix can be used for whole surfaces. It
				is not required to specify it per LinearRing. </rdfs:comment>

   <owl:Class rdf:about="http://www.opengis.net/citygml/2.0#ImplicitGeometryType">
      <rdfs:comment> Type for the implicit representation of a geometry. An implicit geometry is a geometric object, where the
				shape is stored only once as a prototypical geometry, e.g. a tree or other vegetation object, a traffic light or a traffic
				sign. This prototypic geometry object is re-used or referenced many times, wherever the corresponding feature occurs in
				the 3D city model. Each occurrence is represented by a link to the prototypic shape geometry (in a local cartesian
				coordinate system), by a transforma-tion matrix that is multiplied with each 3D coordinate tuple of the prototype, and by
				an anchor point denoting the base point of the object in the world coordinate reference system. In order to determine the
				absolute coordinates of an implicit geometry, the anchor point coordinates have to be added to the matrix multiplication
				results. The transformation matrix accounts for the intended rotation, scaling, and local translation of the prototype. It
				is a 4x4 matrix that is multiplied with the prototype coordinates using homogeneous coordinates, i.e. (x,y,z,1). This way
				even a projection might be modelled by the transformation matrix. The concept of implicit geometries is an enhancement of
				the geometry model of GML3. </rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>Deprecated since CityGML version 0.4.0. Use the concepts of the CityGML Appearance module instead. The
				concept of positioning textures on surfaces complies with the standard X3D. Because there has been no appropriate
				texturing concept in GML3, CityGML adds the class TexturedSurface to the geometry model of GML 3. A texture is specified
				as a raster image referenced by an URI, and can be an arbitrary resource, even in the internet. Textures are positioned by
				employing the concept of texture coordinates, i.e. each texture coordinate matches with exactly one 3D coordinate of the
				TexturedSurface. The use of texture coordinates allows an exact positioning and trimming of the texture on the surface
				geometry. Each surface may be assigned one or more appearances, each refering to one side of the surface.

				There is no differentiation between interior surfaces bounding hollow spaces and outer ones bounding tunnels (one reason

      <rdfs:comment> Specification of the identifier of a sub-premise. Examples of sub-premises are apartments and suites. sub-premises in a building are often uniquely identified by means of consecutive
identifiers. The identifier can be a number, a letter or any combination of the two. In the latter case, the identifier includes exactly one variable (range) part, which is either a 
number or a single letter that is surrounded by fixed parts at the left (prefix) or the right (postfix).</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>Specification of a thoroughfare. A thoroughfare could be a rd, street, canal, river, etc.  Note dependentlocality in a street. For example, in some countries, a large street will 
have many subdivisions with numbers. Normally the subdivision name is the same as the road name, but with a number to identifiy it. Eg. SOI SUKUMVIT 3, SUKUMVIT RD, BANGKOK</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment> A group may be used to aggregate arbitrary CityObjects according to some user-defined criteria. Examples
				for groups are the buildings in a specific region, the result of a query, or objects put together for visualization
				purposes. Each group has a name (inherited from AbstractGMLType), functions (e.g., building group), a class and zero or
				more usages. A geometry may optionally be attached to a group, if the geometry of the whole group differs from the
				geometry of the parts. Each member of a group may be qualified by a role name, reflecting the role each CityObject plays
				in the context of the group. As subclass of _CityObject, a CityObjectGroup inherits all attributes and relations, in
				particular an id, names, external references, and generalization relations. As CityObjectGroup itself is a CityObject, it
				may also be contained by another group. </rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>A Room is a thematic object for modelling the closed parts inside a building. It has to be closed, if
				necessary by using closure surfaces. The geometry may be either a solid, or a MultiSurface if the boundary is not
				topologically clean. The room connectivity may be derived by detecting shared thematic openings or closure surfaces: two
				rooms are connected if both use the same opening object or the same closure surface. The thematic surfaces bounding a room
				are referenced by the boundedBy property. As subclass of _CityObject, a Room inherits all attributes and relations, in
				particular an id, names, external references, and generalization relations. </rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment>Attribute group used to enable property elements to refer to their value remotely. It contains the simple link components from xlinks.xsd, with all members optional, and the remoteSchema attribute, which is also optional.  These attributes can be attached to any element, thus allowing it to act as a pointer. The 'remoteSchema' attribute allows an element  that carries link attributes to indicate that the element is declared  in a remote schema rather than by the schema that constrains the current document instance.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The ISO 19108:2002 hierarchy of subtypes for temporal position are collapsed 
      by defining a union of XML Schema simple types for indicating temporal position relative 
      to a specific reference system. 
      
      Dates and dateTime may be indicated with varying degrees of precision.  
      dateTime by itself does not allow right-truncation, except for fractions of seconds. 
      When used with non-Gregorian calendars based on years, months, days, 
      the same lexical representation should still be used, with leading zeros added if the 
      year value would otherwise have fewer than four digits.  
      
      An ordinal position may be referenced via URI identifying the definition of an ordinal era.  
      
      A time coordinate value is indicated as a decimal (e.g. UNIX time, GPS calendar).</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment> Some common reasons for a null value:   
			
        innapplicable - the object does not have a value
        missing - The correct value is not readily available to the sender of this data.  
                           Furthermore, a correct value may not exist.
        template - the value will be available later
        unknown - The correct value is not known to, and not computable by, the sender of this data. 
                           However, a correct value probably exists.
        withheld - the value is not divulged 
        
        other:reason - as indicated by "reason" string
        
        Specific communities may agree to assign more strict semantics when these terms are used in a particular context.

      <rdfs:comment>Defines allowed values for the knots` type. Uniform knots implies that all knots are of multiplicity 1 and they differ by a positive constant from the preceding knot. Knots are quasi-uniform iff they are of multiplicity (degree + 1) at the ends, of multiplicity 1 elsewhere, and they differ by a positive constant from the preceding knot.</rdfs:comment>

      <rdfs:comment> Specification of the identifier of a sub-premise. Examples of sub-premises are apartments and suites. sub-premises in a building are often uniquely identified by means of consecutive
identifiers. The identifier can be a number, a letter or any combination of the two. In the latter case, the identifier includes exactly one variable (range) part, which is either a 
number or a single letter that is surrounded by fixed parts at the left (prefix) or the right (postfix).</rdfs:comment>
